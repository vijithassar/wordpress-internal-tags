# Overview

Some WordPress site owners may occasionally find it handy to use WordPress tags internally as an organizational tool for site content, without displaying them publicly to readers. This plugin instantiates a secondary clone of the WordPress tagging system using a [custom taxonomy](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy) which is only visible to logged-in users viewing content through the site admin panels.

# Usage

Upload this file to your wp-contents/plugins directory and then enable the plugin from the plugin admin panel.
